# Project Name

## Project Overview
This project is a web application built using Node.js and Express.js that facilitates the management and monitoring of sensors. It utilizes MongoDB for data storage and provides RESTful API endpoints for authentication, sensor management, and alert handling. The application is designed to be scalable and efficient, making it suitable for various IoT applications.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the following variables:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   Start the server by running:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

The server will start and listen on the port specified in the `.env` file.

## Usage
The application exposes several API endpoints to interact with:

- **Authentication Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user
  - `POST /api/auth/login` - Login an existing user

- **Sensor Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/sensors` - Retrieve all sensors
  - `POST /api/sensors` - Add a new sensor

- **Alert Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/alerts` - Fetch all alerts
  - `POST /api/alerts` - Create a new alert based on sensor data

Refer to the API documentation for detailed request and response formats.

## Features
- User authentication (registration and login)
- CRUD operations for sensors and alerts
- Error handling middleware to catch and respond to errors
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- Connection to MongoDB for data persistence

## Dependencies
This project relies on several npm packages. Below is the list of dependencies as found in `package.json`:

- `express`: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- `mongoose`: MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
- `dotenv`: Module to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- `cors`: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- All dependencies can be installed using `npm install`.
